# MembersOnly Project

### This is a simple message post site that let's the user sign up using a username and password and then login. Once logged in a user is greeted by their own dashboard and all the messages posted by the community. Only a VIP member can create a new message and there is an option to become a VIP member by submitting the correct secret code. Only the admin can delete messages. You will need access rights to the database in order to modify the admin property of a user. Only VIP members can see the the author and message times/dates associated with a message.
